This is a hardware algorithm, described by VHDL, that shows sell or buy signals depending on a specific stock.
The main goal of this project is to learn about VHDL.

I want to design a hardware algorithm that compares an accumulated stock value percentage variation with a top win and a top loss specified by the user.
If the accumulated variation is bigger than the top win, it shows the sell flag. If the accumulated variation is lower than the top loss, it shows the buy flag.

I developed a script for the hardware, and a script for a testbench that shows the signals using GTKWave. The simulation can be executed with the run_sim.sh script.Ã‡

For now, the circuit have a maximum of 9ns of latency betwenn input and register reeding, and has no extra latency to response on new percentage variation calculus. That is becouse this architecture calulates asynchronously, becouse it does not need to update any register before it.
